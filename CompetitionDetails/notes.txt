
We collected n=200 ratings of 15 different groups. 
3000 participants (Mage = 39.88, SDage = 13.06; 1554 female, 1393 male, 41 non-binary, 12 undisclosed; 2326 White, 330 Black, 212 East Asian, 80 South Asian, 42 American Indian, 10 Native Hawaiian) living in the United States were recruited from Connect for monetary compensation.

n=134 of each group is available in the training data. 

In the data, we have created all latent factors from the scales already.
We explain the process here in case it informs teams' decisions in any way, or they wish to create latent factors in another way.

First, for every target group separately, we reversed items requiring reversal, and then fit a factor model in lavaan in R.
We then merged all the data for every target group.
We then randomly assigned 67% of the 200 observations of each target group to the training and 33% to the test set.

Below is an example of creating the "symbolic" latent factor, representing symbolic threat in the data. Notice that item 3 is reversed ("sThreat3R" in the data).

library(lavaan)

symbolic<- '
fsymbolic =~ sThreat1 + sThreat2 + sThreat3R + sThreat4'

fitsymbolic<- cfa(symbolic, data=d, bootstrap=5000, missing="ml")
summary (fitsymbolic, fit.measures=TRUE, standardized=TRUE)
d$symbolic <- lavaan::lavPredict(fitsymbolic, method="regression")
